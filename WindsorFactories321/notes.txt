IDisposable typed factories are not multiple Dispose() safe (!)
IDisposable typed factories can be disposed before being released
IDisposable typed factories cannot be disposed after having been released (!)

released typed factories dispose all not yet released fabricated objects
    and the whole transitive closure of their non-singleton dependencies
same for factories which are dependencies of released components
this happens regardless of whether the factory is IDisposable or not
if a fabricated component is not released, its dependencies will be disposed twice when the factory is released (!)

disposal of the transitive dependency closure disposes dependencies of longer-lived components (!)
given a dependency graph:
FF(T) -> F(T) -> GS(S) -> GF(T)
releasing FF will dispose GF, breaking GS!

TODO: check above scenario when GF is not a factory
